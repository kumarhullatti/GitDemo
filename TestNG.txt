testNG:1
   testNG is a unit testing tool. TestNG is advanced than the Junit.

   It is mainly used to run the code in a systemmatic order based on the annotations present in the testNG.

   It is a replacement for the main method.
---------------------------------------------
Q: Advantages of TestNG?
1. It has more annotations than Junit
2. It has more conditions than Junit
3. In testng the execution can be controlled by using testng.xml file
4. TestNG has reporting mechanism (it automatically creates two different .html reports viz.,
    (a) emailable-report.html
    (b) index.html
5. DataProvider is present in testNG
6. Dependency testing can be achieved in testNG
7. We can group the tests and run them based on the group names.
8. In testNG batch execution is possible @ different levels through testng.xml file viz.,
   (a) package level
   (b) class level
   (c) method level

8. All the annotaions names are not confusing like junit (Ex: @Before, @After). Here the annotaions names are straight forward.
9. Here methods can be either static OR non-static


---------------------
Q: How to install testNG?
Case 1:
Go to Eclipse->Help->Eclipse MarketPlace-> search for testNG->once search is found & the testNG is not installed then install it.


Case 2:
Go to Eclipse->Help->Install new Software->Add the URL http://beust.com/eclipse-> Select testNG checkbox & continue installation.

Case 3:
Copy the TestNG jars (Manually download OR through Maven pom.xml you can download automatically) to eclipse & set the build path

----------------------
TestNG annotations: The annotations are the classes in testng which will have a definite predefined execution order/flow..

@Test
@BeforeSuite
@AfterSuite
@BeforeTest
@AfterTest
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeGroups
@AfterGroups
@Parameters
@DataProvider

Conditions: All conditions are associated with @Test annotation.
@Test(timeout=<milliseconds>)
@Test(expectedExceptions=<exception>.class)
@Test(enabled=false)
@Test(priority=<numbers>)
@Test(groups={"groups names"})
@Test(dataProvider={""})
@Test(dependsOnMethods={""})
@Test(dependsOnGroups={""})
@Test(alwaysRun=true)
@Test(invocationCount=<numbers>)

-----------------------------------------
@Test: This annotation is used for Test scripts only. Here all the @Test will run in Ascending order based on the method name by default.


@BeforeSuite: The method with this annotation will always runs first with respect to testNG suite level.


@AfterSuite: The method with this annotation will always runs last with respect to testNG suite level 


@BeforeTest: The method with this annotation will always runs first with respect to the test level which is present inside the testng.xml file


@AfterTest: The method with this annotation will always runs last with respect to the test level which is present inside the testng.xml file


@BeforeClass: The method with this annotation will always run first with respect to the perticular class.


@AfterClass: The method with this annotation will always run last with respect to the perticular class.


@BeforeMethod: The method with this annotation will always run first for every @Test annotations.


@AfterMethod: The method with this annotation will always run last for every @Test annotations


@BeforeGroups(): The method with this annotation will always run first with respect to the group name mentioned.


@AfterGroups(): The method with this annotation will always run last with respect to the group name mentioned.


@Parameters: This annotation is used to parameterize the testNG @Test with simple data/values.


@DataProvider: This annotation is used to parameterize the testNG Tests with complex data/values viz., Collection, Arrays, Object, data read from the property file, xml file, database etc.

---------------------

@Test(timeout=<milliseconds>): Timeout test in testng


@Test(expectedExceptions=<exception>.class): Exception test in testNG


@Test(enabled=false): The testNG will not execute the perticular test.


@Test(priority=<numbers>): We can prioritize the testNG tests & execute them based on the priority mentioned. The priority will start from zero. If we don't mention the priority to the @Test, then by default it will be zero.


@Test(groups={"group names"}): It is used to specify the group name to the testNG @Test


@Test(dataProvider={""}): It is used to use the dataprovide name to the perticular @Test


@Test(dependsOnMethods={""}): To achieve the dependency test at method level


@Test(dependsOnGroups={""}): To achieve the dependency test at group level


@Test(alwaysRun=true): In dependency test, If the dependency fails then the dependent will be skipped by the testNG automatically. To override this behaviour & to run the dependent test even after dependency fails we use this condition.


@Test(invocationCount=<numbers>): It is used to run the testNG tests Nth time

-----------------------------------
Q: Difference between Assert & Verify?
Ans:
Assert: Assertion is a validation point.
Assertion upon failure, it will not run the below lines of code for the particular block.

Verify: Verify is a validation point.
Verify upon failure, it will run the below lines of code for the particular block as well. But overall test status will be failed.


--------------------
Q: Assertions in Junit:
Ans:
     Assert.assertTrue();
     Assert.assertFalse();
     Assert.assertNull();
     Assert.assertNotNull();
     Assert.assertEquals()
     Assert.assertNotEquals();
     Assert.assertSame();
     Assert.assertNotSame();
     Assert.assertArrayEquals(): It is not in testNG



Q: Assertions in testNG?
in testng 2 types of assertions are present
 (1) Hard Assertion
     Assert.assertTrue();
     Assert.assertFalse();
     Assert.assertNull();
     Assert.assertNotNull();
     Assert.assertEquals()
     Assert.assertNotEquals();
     Assert.assertSame();
     Assert.assertNotSame();

 (2) Soft Assertion
     SoftAssert soft = new SoftAssert();
     soft.assertTrue();
     soft.assertFalse();
     soft.assertNull();
     soft.assertNotNull();
     soft.assertEquals();
     soft.assertNotEquals();
     soft.assertSame();
     soft.assertNotSame();
     soft.assertAll();


Q: Difference between HardAssert & SoftAssert in testNG?
Ans:
	HardAssert		SoftAssert
1. Upon failure, it will stop       1. Upon failure, it will not
the execution of whole block       stop the block. Instead it
OR below codes within                 will continue execution.
the blocks

2. Results will be captured        2. Upon failure, it wont  
upon failure.                         capture the result.Instead								
                                      it shows test passed. To
                                      capture the failure we 
                                      need to use .assertAll()
                                      method at the end of test.							

3. Assert class contains           3. SoftAssert class contains
assertion methods which             assertion methods which
are static in nature                  are non-static




Q: Difference between .assertEquals() & .assertSame()?
Ans:
.assertEquals(): It checks whether both the values are same

.assertSame(): IT checks whether both value & object references are same.
